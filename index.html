        <div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto mb-5">
            <p class="mb-5">
                In this coursework you are required as an individual, to design, build, test and evaluate a 
                prototype web application that employs the technologies you will learn throughout the module. 
                You are asked to build a Voter Registration web application for user registration and authentication, 
                search and verification, adding, updating voter information, council wise segmentation, notifications 
                and reminders.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                The application is required to have more than one role and the roles are user, election 
                officer and admin. Voters can register by providing personal details. Verify user identity 
                during login. Users can search for their names in the voter list and verify their registration 
                status. Display information such as name, address, and polling station. Election officials 
                can add new voters or update existing voter details. Organize voters by councils,and polling 
                stations. Send notifications about upcoming electionsand po ling dates. Announcements like 
                Broadcast important messages to voters. The final functionality and specification of the web 
                application you create is up to you.

            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                As a minimum your application is likely to have 4 interface pages to allow users: to log in; 
                to view a group of voters, to view an individual voter, and to add a voter. But it may have 
                more depending on the functionality you decide to include. Note you may use standard templates, 
                libraries, or existing APIs to support your design, but they must be acknowledged in your final 
                report.
